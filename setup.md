There are several pieces of software you will wish to install on your laptop before the workshop. Though installation help will be provided at the workshop,  we recommend that these tools are installed (or at least downloaded) beforehand.

## Windows 10 Users

 1. Download [bash-lesson.tar.gz]({{ page.root}}//hpc-intro/files/bash-lesson.tar.gz).  Move the data.zip file to your Desktop.
 2. Install [MobaXterm Home Edition](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html)
    - We recommend the "Installer edition" (green button)
    - Unzip the MobaXterm Installer ZIP before running the MSI installer file
 3. In MobaXterm: Click *Start Local terminal* button in the centre of the MobaXterm window

## Mac Users

 1. Hold down alt(option) and [bash-lesson.tar.gz]({{ page.root}}//hpc-intro/files/bash-lesson.tar.gz). The option key stops Safari from unzipping the file.  Move the data.zip file to your Desktop.
 2. To enable graphical Linux applications, [install XQuartz](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201341).
 3. Open the Terminal app from Applications/Utilities
 
## Linux Users

The instructions for Linux depend on your Linux distribution and setup.  You will need to follow these general steps:
 1. Download [bash-lesson.tar.gz]({{ page.root}}//hpc-intro/files/bash-lesson.tar.gz). Move the data.zip file to your Desktop.
 2. Open your Linux version's Terminal application
